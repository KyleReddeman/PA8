Welcome to Ateroids!

Or that's what I would say if I could figure how to do collision dettection
using SFML(seems to be insanely difficult from what I've seen online).
Since collision detection doesn't work, you could hardly call this a game,
however, all the elements are in place, and most of the mechanics are there.
Just never got to implent the destroying of objects.

Controls:

UP:    move player forward.
LEFT:  rotate player left.
RIGHT: rotate player right.
SPACE: Shoot projectile (Only 5 can be on screen at a time, so aim carefully(Note: shooting does nothing)).

Side Notes: 
Both the player and asteroids can move out of bounds and wrap around to the other side. However the player's
bullets cannot and will be destroyed once they go out of bounds.

This project uses SFML. Not sure what kind of configuration you'll have to do to run this.
